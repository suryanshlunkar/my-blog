Hello and welcome to my blog!

I'm Suryansh Lunkar, and this blog is a special place where I share the cherished memories of my childhood. Growing up in India, there are countless moments that bring a smile to my face even today. This blog is a collection of those memories, moments that shaped my childhood and continue to warm my heart.

### Reliving the Good Old Days

Do you remember waking up early on Sunday mornings, eagerly waiting for the cartoon marathons? Shows like Shinchan and Doraemon were our companions, making us laugh and teaching us little life lessons. I vividly remember the excitement of watching Shinchan’s mischief or Doraemon’s futuristic gadgets that we all wished we could have. These cartoons weren’t just shows; they were an integral part of our childhood, creating memories that we still hold dear.

### The Magic of Summer Vacations

Summer vacations were the best, weren't they? Long days filled with playing cricket in the gullies, drinking Rooh Afza to beat the heat, and listening to stories from our grandparents. The anticipation of mango season, with aamras and mango pickles, was a highlight. Those days were carefree and full of joy, a stark contrast to our busy lives today.

### Festivals and Family Gatherings

Indian festivals brought families together, creating a sense of unity and joy. Diwali with its diyas and firecrackers, Holi with its vibrant colors, and the delicious sweets made by our mothers and grandmothers – these are the moments that I cherish deeply. The laughter, the fun, and the togetherness made every festival a beautiful experience.

### School Days and Friends

Remember the first day of school, the nervousness of meeting new friends, and the excitement of learning new things? School days were a blend of studies and fun, where we made friends for life. The tiffin boxes filled with homemade parathas, the last-minute homework copying, and the joy of bunking classes for a game of football – these memories are priceless.

### Join Me in This Journey

This blog is my attempt to relive those wonderful days and share them with you. I hope my stories resonate with your own childhood memories and bring a smile to your face. Let’s take a trip down memory lane together, celebrating the simple joys and unforgettable moments of our childhood.

With warm memories,  
Suryansh Lunkar"
